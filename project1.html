	  <p>Most teenagers require 8-10 hours of sleep each night. However, many teens are unable to reach this number. This is due to the fact that many teenagers are unable to fall asleep until 11 o’clock at night because of adolescence shifting many people’s sleep schedules to later times. Teens also need to wake up as early as six in the morning, and when students are unable to sleep until 11 at night many teens are having to get through the day on 6-8 hours of sleep.
Working on a sleep deficit can cause many problems at school. Teenage students can experience an inability to concentrate or remember important information. It can also cause diet issues, and even become more prone to sickness.
